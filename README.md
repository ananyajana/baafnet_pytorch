# baafnet_pytorch

tried to create a pytorch implementation (unofficial) of BAAF-Net ( Semantic Segmentation for Real Point Cloud Scenes via Bilateral Augmentation and Adaptive Fusion CVPR 2021 ). The current model handles only one scale of images, but it can be extended to multiple scales with minor changes.
